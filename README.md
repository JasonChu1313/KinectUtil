# KinectUtil
This project is used to solve the mismatch problem of rgb and depth camera of Kinect camera in order to get high quality point cloud. For calibration stage, we use 2 method to calibrate the camera, using DLT and Zhangzhengyouâ€˜s checkerboard to calculate the camera parameters, and using these parameters to project and retroject from the image captured by RGB and depth camera.
